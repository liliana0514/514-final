# Color Analyzer
A **smart color collector** for your future design ðŸ’¡ 

### Background
- In design and art, getting colors right is tricky. Designers and artists struggle to capture exact shades from life or other works. 
- Usually, picking colors is pretty subjective, which can mess up how the final work looks and communicates. 
- Plus, thereâ€™s no easy way to turn real-life colors into digital codes, making the whole process even more of a headache. 

### Proposed Solution
- TCS2300 color sensor allowing for detailed calibration and precise capture of new color parameters. With its built-in Bluetooth functionality, the analyzer sends color and lux values in real time to a display device. A stepper Motor automatically rotates to the corresponding angle based on color parameters, offering physical feedback.
